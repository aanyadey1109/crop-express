    <section class="about">
        <p>Welcome to The Crop Express, your guide to understanding the critical issue of endangered crops and the
            innovative science behind saving them. Our diverse planet is home to countless plant species that not only
            sustain our diets but also drive biodiversity and ecosystems. However, climate change, habitat destruction,
            and unsustainable farming practices have placed many of these vital crops at risk. Through this platform, we
            aim to shed light on the threats faced by these plants, explore cutting-edge methods like genetic
            preservation, sustainable farming, and advanced biotechnologies, and empower you with knowledge to take
            action. Together, let‚Äôs preserve the roots of our future!</p>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="text-box">Climate change poses one of the greatest threats to agricultural diversity,
                significantly impacting crop survival. Rising temperatures, unpredictable weather patterns, and
                prolonged droughts disrupt traditional farming cycles, reducing crop yields. Extreme events like floods
                and heat waves further destroy fertile lands and make it difficult for specific crops to adapt. For
                example, staple crops like wheat and maize struggle in regions facing prolonged heat stress, while
                shifting seasons affect the germination and flowering cycles of many plants, leaving them vulnerable to
                extinction.</div>

            </div>
            <div class="text-box">As societies modernize, traditional agricultural practices and indigenous knowledge
                are often sidelined in favor of industrialized farming methods. These shifts lead to a decline in the
                cultivation of native and heritage crops that were once staples in local diets. The global preference
                for a limited number of commercially viable crops has resulted in the neglect of diverse plant species,
                reducing their presence in the fields and threatening their survival.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="text-box">Biodiversity loss is another major driver of crop endangerment. Natural ecosystems are
                rapidly disappearing due to deforestation, urbanization, and monoculture farming. This loss of diverse
                plant species weakens the resilience of ecosystems, as interdependent relationships between crops,
                pollinators, and soil organisms are disrupted. The lack of genetic diversity in farming systems also
                makes crops more susceptible to pests and diseases, increasing the risk of extinction for specific
                varieties.</div>

                </span>
            </div>
            <div class="text-box">Economic challenges force many farmers to prioritize short-term profitability over
                sustainable practices. Limited access to financial resources compels them to grow high-yield, commercial
                crops instead of traditional varieties that might be less lucrative but are vital for genetic diversity.
                The high costs of seeds, fertilizers, and pest control also lead to an over-reliance on monoculture,
                further pushing endangered crops to the brink. Without adequate support, farmers struggle to preserve
                diverse crop species essential for long-term food security.
